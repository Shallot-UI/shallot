# Shallot

Shallot is a toolkit that makes it easier to design and build applications across web and mobile with a common theme. There are three main ways we achieve this:

1. **Theme & Mixins**: We provide a theme object that contains a set of tokens that can be used to style components. We also provide a set of mixins that can be used to apply these tokens to components.
2. **The `Shallot` Prop**: We provide a prop called `shallot` that resembles the classic `style` prop, but includes support for mixins. You can use it to easily apply mixin styles to any component.
3. **Cross-Platform Primitives**: We provide a set of components with simple style props that can be used to build applications.

To start, let's make an SVG icon component that can pull its fill color from the theme.

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components'
import { getStyle } from '@shallot-ui/web'

// Since getStyle is a typed fnction, this `svg` will now automatically accept
// the `shallot` prop so we can apply the mixin styles to the SVG element.
export const Icon = styled.svg(getStyle)
```

Now, we can use the `Icon` component to render an icon with a fill color from the theme.

```tsx
import { getColorShade } from '@shallot-ui/web'

const MyIcon = () => <Icon shallot={{ fill: getColorShade('Primary.500') }} />
```

We can even extend the component to accept a `color` prop that will override the `fill` color from the theme.

```tsx
import { FC } from 'react'
import { getColorShade, AllColorShades } from '@shallot-ui/web'

const MyIcon = ({ fill }): FC<{ fill: AllColorShades }> => (
  <Icon shallot={{ fill }} />
)
```
