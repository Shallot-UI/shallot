# ðŸŽ¨ Theme

The theme is the core of the design system. It is a set of variables that define the colors, typography, spacing, and other design decisions. You can use Shallot to reference theme tokens like colors, sizes, grid units, and typography to bring consistency to your components.

## Creating a theme

You can create a theme by using the `theme` prop on the `ShallotProvider` component. It takes an object as a parameter and returns a complete theme object. The object can contain any of the following properties:

- `colors`: An object containing the color tokens.
- `typography`: An object containing the typography tokens.
- `grid`: An object containing the grid tokens.
- `breakpoints`: An object containing the breakpoints tokens.
- `variants`: An object containing styles for different variants of your components.

## Variants

With variants, developers can easily override specific styles of a component, allowing for seamless customization and theming. This feature is particularly useful for reusing frequently used styles across different components, streamlining the development process and promoting consistency in the UI design. To implement variants, add a `variants` object to your theme with any components you want to customize as keys. The value of each key should be an object containing the variants you want to create. Each variant should be a key with a value of an object containing the styles you want to apply.

For example, if you want to create a `circle` variant for the `Box` component, you can do so by adding the following to your theme:

```tsx
const theme = {
  //... other theme properties

  variants: {
    Box: {
      circle: {
        borderRadius: '50%',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

You can then use the `variant` prop on the `Box` component to apply the `circle` variant:

```tsx
<Box variant="circle" />
```

\***\*Note**: The component name **must** be capitalized in your theme object. ex. theme.**Box**.variants instead of theme.**box**.variants\*\*
