# Variants

With variants, developers can easily override specific styles of a component, allowing for seamless customization and theming. This feature is particularly useful for reusing frequently used styles across different components, streamlining the development process and promoting consistency in the UI design. To implement variants, add a `variants` object to your theme with any components you want to customize as keys. The value of each key should be an object containing the variants you want to create. Each variant should be a key with a value of an object containing the styles you want to apply.

For example, if you want to create a `circle` variant for the `Box` component, you can do so by adding the following to your theme:

```tsx
const theme = {
  //... other theme properties

  variants: {
    Box: {
      circle: {
        borderRadius: '50%',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

You can then use the `variant` prop on the `Box` component to apply the `circle` variant:

```tsx
<Box variant="circle" />
```

Another example using the text component:

```tsx
const theme = {
  //... other theme properties

  variants: {
    Box: {
      circle: {
        borderRadius: '50%',
      },
    },
    Text: {
      heading: {
        fontStyle: 'italic',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

```tsx
<Text variant="heading">This is a heading</Text>
```

\***\*Note**: The component name **must** be capitalized in your theme object. ex. theme.**Box**.variants instead of theme.**box**.variants\*\*
