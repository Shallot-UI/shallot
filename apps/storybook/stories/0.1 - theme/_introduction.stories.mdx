# ðŸŽ¨ Theme

The theme is the core of the design system. It is a set of variables that define the colors, typography, spacing, and other design decisions. You can use Shallot to reference theme tokens like colors, sizes, grid units, and typography to bring consistency to your components.

## Creating a theme

You can create a theme by using the `makeTheme()` function. It takes an object as a parameter and returns a complete theme object. The object can contain any of the following properties:

- `colors`: An object containing the color tokens.
- `typography`: An object containing the typography tokens.
- `grid`: An object containing the grid tokens.
- `breakpoints`: An object containing the breakpoints tokens.
