## Installation

Since Shallot is built on Styled Components, installation is quite simple. Once you've installed `styled-components`, you can install the shallot package for your project and replace your `<ThemeProvider />` with a `<ShallotProvider />`.

<br />

Choose the **package that matches your platform:**

```shell
pnpm i @shallot-ui/react # Default package for React
pnpm i @shallot-ui/next # Optimized for Next JS
pnpm i @shallot-ui/email # Stripped down for react-email
pnpm i @shallot-ui/react-native # Default package for React Native
```

Now you can wrap your project in a `<ShallotProvider />` instead of a `<ThemeProvider />` and you will have a valid Shallot theme ready to use.

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'
import { ShallotProvider } from '@shallot-ui/next'

const Layout: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => (
  <ShallotProvider>{children}</ShallotProvider>
)
```

Using any Shallot component will now use the theme you've provided. All of the fonts, colors, and spacing from the default theme will be applied.

```tsx
import { H1 } from '@shallot-ui/next'

const Page = () => <H1>Hello World</H1>
```
