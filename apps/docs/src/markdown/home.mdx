# ðŸ§… Shallot UI

Shallot is a design and theme system for [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), it was crafted to provide a powerful and flexible developer experience for styling on complex projects.

- **Great Developer Experience:** Styles are derived from a standard theme object using elegant mixins with [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) support.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Share a single set of theme tokens and variants between `react`, `react-native`, and `react-email` features of a platform.
- **Completely Flexible:** Add custom tokens, build your own mixins, use mixins directly in Styled Components' syntax, and more!

## Example

Here's a page rendered using default Shallot components. You can see how our style props can be used to easily define a layout that will be legible for developers and themeable for designers.

```tsx
import { Column, Fold, H1, P } from '@shallot-ui/next'

const Page = () => (
  <Fold alignCenter alignMiddle>
    <Column unitsAround={2} unitGap={2}>
      <H1>Hello World</H1>
      <P>Welcome to Shallot.</P>
    </Column>
  </Fold>
)

export default Page
```

### Theme variants

Components like `H1` and `P` in this example are the default `Text` component with variants applied. Here's the default variant definition for H1:

```ts
import { getFontFamily, getFontSize, getGlobal } from '@shallot-ui/next'

const headingOne: ShallotProp = {
  fontFamily: getFontFamily('Body'),
  fontSize: getFontSize('xl'),
  color: getGlobal('foregroundFadeColor'),
  fontWeight: 600,
}
```

Here's the actual definition of the `H1` component:

```ts
import { withTextShallot } from '@shallot-ui/next'

export const H1 = withTextShallot('h1', {}, { variant: 'H1' })
```

### Cross-Platform Support

Shallot provides cross-platform versions of many of its standard components. For example, this entire page could be adapted to React Native with a single line change:

```diff
- import {(Column, Fold, H1, P)} from '@shallot-ui/next'
+ import {(Column, Fold, H1, P)} from '@shallot-ui/native'
```
